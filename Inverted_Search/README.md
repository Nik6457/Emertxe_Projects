This is the ReadME file reagrding the project Inverted Search.

This project aims to allow fast text searches when the document is added
to the database. By using hash algorithm the document is stored into the
database. If we want to check the particular word in the database it will
give information how many times and how many files that word is present.
The main aim is to find the easy and better way to find the information.
