This ReadME regarding Image Stegnography using LSB encoding and decoding project.

Developed an image stegnography tool to securely encode and decode secret file into
BMP images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
This project was focused on providing a method to conceal sensitive information within 
image files in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye.
